# ISL
Overview

There are quite a few attempts to teach the Indian Sign Language (ISL) to interested persons. There are NGOs working in the area to promote the ISL so that the deaf persons could better communicate with others, thus enriching their lives and creating opportunities for employment. However the challenge is that these efforts require a lay person to learn the ISL, which is hard to motivate since the need is not felt beyond the initial rush of the good intention. As a result, the deaf person remains marginalised and not able to fulfill their potential.

On the other hand, these NGOs have done a great work to upload videos teaching the ISL to anyone who is interested. These videos are available on YouTube or on the NGO websites. These videos could be used to train an ML model in ISL. Additionally, one could leverage the local NGOs that work with deaf people to build additional,purpose made videos to improve the ML model training gaps if any are identified during the training.

The proposal that this paper makes is to use ML technologies to assist in translating the ISL gestures into a natural language, and vice versa. This proposal envisions that the fully equipped person will have a purpose built app on her phone. This app will facilitate communication with the deaf person in the following manner:

Deaf person speaking:
Full bodied (FB) person will run the app and turn the camera towards the deaf person (DP). 
Camera records the DP's hand/body gestures and movements. 
These gestures are then run through the AI prediction to generate an equivalent English text, which is either shown on the screen or spoken through the phone microphone.

Full bodied person speaking:
FB person runs the app and speaks into it. 
The speech is translated into text and that is then further translated into a sequence of ISL gestures by the ML algorithm. 
These gestures are then applied on a preselected photo of the FB person to build a video, as if the FB person is speaking in ISL.
The video is seen on the app by the DP.



Opportunity

The tech developed for this initiative will always be free to the individuals. According to the wikipedia article, India has close to 63 million deaf people. The same article says that only 26.1% of the 15 million deaf persons within the working age are employed. One could only guess this to be the case due to a) lack of education within the deaf community; and b) due to their inherent lack of ability to communicate. This population could benefit immensely if they have access to the proposed app through which they could carry out meaningful conversation with the general public. 

However, there is still this question of dealing with the running cost. There’d be cost associated with the regular innovations to further improve the technology and then there’d be the cost of running the infrastructure. At the moment, the dream is to pay for the running cost through the generous donations from the CSR activities of the companies as well as individuals. The cost model needs to be worked out as we start getting serious in building the tech and then to take it live. Yet, there are a few additional revenue opportunities that’d have to be tried once the tech reaches the level of sophistication. These are:
Video content producers including TV content producers could benefit by having a small popup that’d play the ISL translation of the conversation that is shown on the screen.
Online teaching medium could use the tech in the similar manner as above.
One could question whether the above use case is a valid use case or not, and whether the above problem is already solved by automatic transcription of the conversation. It is to be seen whether the ISL translation makes for a better immersive experience than the running closed caption text.
